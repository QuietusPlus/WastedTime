# General

Welcome to the **Wasted Time** information page.

Please feel free and ask officers if you're unsure about something. It's always better to ask a and get something right rather than being afraid and getting something wrong.

# Raids

The schedule is an estimate and may change. Always make sure you check the in-game calendar for up-to-date information.

We have both casual and progression raids.

Invites begin at `19:30` and the first boss is pulled `5` minutes after the indicated start time.

## Casual

These are meant for players who are not in the progression team but would still like to raid. This is also a good way to show that you're ready for the progression raid (if that's something you want).

| Day    | Start   | End     |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| Friday | `20:00` | `23:00` |

## Progression

This is an invite-only team where we try to push the content on higher difficulties.

| Day       | Start   | End     |
| --------- | ------- | ------- |
| Monday    | `20:00` | `22:00` |
| Wednesday | `20:00` | `22:00` |

## Item Level

The item level requirements are based on raid difficulty and are as follows:

| Difficulty | Item Level |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Normal     | `400`      |
| Heroic     | `415`      |

## Rules

### Sign-ups

If you cannot make it in time please let any of the officers know.

Players who are signed up but don't show up will get flagged _(if they don't have a valid reason)_. If this happens too often these players will **NOT** be invited back.

### Consumables

Players are **required** to bring their own `Food` and `Flasks`.

For additional buffs you may also want to bring `Potions` and/or `Augmment Runes`, this is however **optional**.

> **NOTICE**
> 
> Feasts and/or cauldrons may be provided but are never a guarantee. Do **not** expect these consumables to be provided each and every time!.

### Encounters

Players are expected to have researched raid encounters. We recommend watching `FATBOSS` videos for this. Alternatively there is also a [written guide](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/azsharas-eternal-palace-raid-overview) over at Wowhead.
